# General info

# Main controls
In the main controls (on the left), you can find several buttons and sliders.

## Start (Button)
This button will start and stop SynthQuencer. When you restart SynthQuencer, it will always start on the first row.

## Speed (Slider)
The speed slider set the speed of SynthQuencer (the time it takes to go to the next step). It is set in milliseconds (ms)

The speed slider is somewhat of a special slider because when you slide it, it's value updates in realtime. The effects are not applied immediately. When you release the slider, then will SynthQuencer automatically restart to apply the changes.

## Volume (Slider)
The volume slider is a value between 0 and 1. This will multiply with the gain at different points (see Envelope). This will update for every note that is played after adjusting it's value.
