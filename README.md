# SynthQuencer
SynthQuencer is a sequencer that is easy to use and does not require the user to have any knowledge of coding or music, just press some buttons and see what happens!

SynthQuencer is not finished yet, but I doubt it will ever be... This is still a hobby project and definitely not my only focus. If I sometime stop working on it, but you encounter a bug or want a feature, open up an issue, I'll still see it (probably) and I might start working on it again!
