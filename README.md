# SynthQuencer
SynthQuencer is a sequencer that is easy to use and does not require the user to have any knowledge of coding or music, just press some buttons and see what happens!

SynthQuencer is not finished yet, but we doubt it will ever be! Maybe the development will slow down or even stop. That might be because we can't think of newer features! If you want to help it start up again, consider opening a issue with an feature request or a bug report!
